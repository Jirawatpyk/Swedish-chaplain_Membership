/**
 * Application port — sub-processor erasure propagation for the member-erasure
 * cascade (COMP-1 US3-C, GDPR Art. 17 / PDPA §33).
 *
 * Post-commit best-effort step: after `eraseMember`'s atomic scrub tx commits,
 * the cascade hands the `(audience, email)` pairs captured pre-redaction
 * (Task 3 `BroadcastsAudienceDerivationPort`) to this port, which propagates
 * the erasure to external sub-processors so the member's PII is removed from
 * their systems too:
 *
 *   - Resend  — remove the member's email from every audience it received
 *               broadcasts in (so a future broadcast never re-reaches an
 *               erased member).
 *   - Stripe  — a PURE no-op TODAY. There is no member↔Stripe-customer model
 *               in Chamber-OS (F5 payments are ad-hoc Payment Intents, never
 *               persisted Stripe Customers keyed to a member). `stripeOutcome`
 *               is typed as the literal `'ok'` so a future customer-erasure
 *               path widens it EXPLICITLY (a new union member) rather than
 *               silently passing through. ZERO payments symbols are imported.
 *
 * Best-effort — the port contract is NEVER-THROWS (mirrors the F6/F7/F8
 * cascade ports). A sub-processor outage must not fail the member-erasure
 * flow: the member's OWN-system PII is already durably scrubbed by the atomic
 * tx; sub-processor propagation is a follow-up the US2d reconciler / US3-E
 * DPO runbook re-drives on a `partial`/`failed` outcome.

 * for the `subprocessor_erasure_propagated` audit payload + the metric, so a union
 * would force a needless switch with no field-presence safety gained. The
 * coherence invariant (`'ok'⇔failed===0`, `'failed'⇔removed===0 && failed>0`,
 * `'partial'⇔both>0`) is enforced at the SINGLE producer — the adapter derives all
 * three fields together from the loop counts; the shape is never hand-assembled
