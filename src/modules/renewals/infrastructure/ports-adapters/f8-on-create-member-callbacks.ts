/**
 * F8-completion Slice 1 · Task 1.6 — F3 → F8 create-member onboarding
 * bridge.
 *
 * F8 listener registration for the F3 member-create event. A single
 * listener runs POST-COMMIT on every new member created via the admin
 * `createMember` use-case: it creates the member's INITIAL renewal cycle
 * (anchored at the member's `registration_date` — advanced to the current
 * membership period when the date is backdated, see R2-1 below — frozen at
 * the resolved plan price) so the new member enters the renewal pipeline.
 *
 * This is the **post-launch onboarding** arm only — the initial 131-member
 * SweCham cohort is cold-started by the import (Task 1.7), not by this
 * listener.
 *
 * Mirrors `f2-plan-change-bridge.ts:f8OnManualPlanChangeCallbacks`: the
 * factory builds the F8 deps via `makeRenewalsDeps(tenantId)`, and the
 * listener opens its OWN `runInTenant(deps.tenant, …)` tx (re-establishing
 * RLS) and calls the shared `createCycleInTx` helper.
 *
 * **Failure semantics — the listener DELIBERATELY does NOT swallow.**
 *
 * Unlike the plan-change bridge (whose `wrapListener` catches + counts
 * internally), this listener lets `createCycleInTx`'s throw propagate to
 * `createMember`'s post-commit invoke loop, which is the canonical swallow
 * site: it logs + bumps `renewalsMetrics.bootstrapCycleCreateFailed` +
 * returns `ok` (the member is already committed; see create-member.ts).
 * Routing the swallow through the use-case loop keeps a single best-effort
 * contract — a raw throwing listener and this factory listener behave
 * identically (the unit test exercises the raw path; the integration test
 * exercises this one). createCycleInTx is idempotent via
 * `findActiveForMemberInTx`, so a future replay (admin re-trigger) is a
 * safe no-op.
 *
 * Pure Infrastructure — only `@/lib/db` (runInTenant) + `createCycleInTx`
 * + `makeRenewalsDeps` + `node:crypto` + the cycle-id brand imports.
