/**
 * Renewal rolling-anchor refactor (design 2026-07-08 rev 3, migration 0238)
 * — `resolveUnlinkedMembershipPaymentInTx` (the unlinked-invoice on-paid
 * hook).
 *
 * F4 fires `F4InvoicePaidEvent` for EVERY paid invoice (event-fee or
 * membership). Before this hook existed, `markCycleCompleteInTx`'s
 * `no_cycle_for_invoice` branch was a silent no-op whenever the paid
 * invoice was not the one F8 itself dispatched — an admin-created ad-hoc
 * membership invoice never anchored or renewed anything (bug F-1). This
 * hook classifies the payment via the shared `classifyMembershipPayment`
 * (the SAME classifier every settlement site consumes — one source of
 * truth) and settles the member's renewal state accordingly:
 *
 *   - `heal_no_cycle` — a member with zero cycle rows ever self-heals: a
 *     fresh cycle is created anchored at the payment month, closing the
 *     DV-18 members-without-cycle gap at exactly the right moment.
 *   - `first_payment` — the member's one-and-only cycle has never been
 *     anchored to a real payment; it is RE-ANCHORED (not completed) to
 *     the actual payment month, re-freezing the plan's frozen fields when
 *     the re-anchor crosses a fiscal-year boundary.
 *   - `renewal` — the open cycle completes (paid) and the next cycle is
 *     created gapless at `periodTo` (mirrors the steady-state
 *     `createNextCycleOnPaidInTx` seam).
 *   - `not_applicable` (erased / terminal_only) and a non-membership
 *     `invoiceSubject` are no-ops — the member's renewal state does not
 *     move.
 *
 * Every settlement branch writes state + emits its audit event in the
 * SAME tx as the payment (Constitution Principle VIII). Infra throws
 * propagate so F4's payment tx rolls back and the at-least-once webhook
 * retry (or admin retry) heals — this hook NEVER swallows a throw after
 * a write.
 *
 * Degraded-mode refusal: this hook must NEVER run outside F4's real
 * payment tx. `markCycleCompleteInTx`'s `allowUnlinkedResolution` flag
 * (defaulted `true` for the atomic in-tx path, forced `false` by the
 * `markCycleCompleteFromInvoicePaid` wrapper) enforces this — see that
 * file's docstring for the three sanctioned wrapper uses.
 *
 * Pure Application — orchestrates Domain via port interfaces only. No
 * ORM / HTTP / framework / React imports (Constitution Principle III).

/**
 * FR-005b parity fix (Task 5 review F4) — the blocked-member counterpart
 * to `renewalComplete`. Mirrors `markCycleCompleteInTx`'s
 * `holdForAdminReview` gate on the LINKED path: a member with
 * `blocked_from_auto_reactivation = true` must not silently auto-complete
 * via this UNLINKED hook either. The open cycle is routed to
 * `pending_admin_reactivation` instead of `completed`, and — unlike
 * `renewalComplete` — NO next cycle is created; the admin decides what
 * happens next via the existing T136/T137/T138 admin-review actions.
 *
 * `awaiting_payment` cycles transition directly (the same single legal
 * edge `holdForAdminReview` uses). `upcoming`/`reminded` cycles have no
 * direct edge into `pending_admin_reactivation` (see `TRANSITIONS` in
 * `cycle-status.ts` — only `awaiting_payment` and `lapsed` do), so they
 * take the two legal steps in the SAME tx:
 * `upcoming|reminded → awaiting_payment → pending_admin_reactivation`.
 * (`classifyMembershipPayment` only ever hands this branch `upcoming` or
 * `awaiting_payment` — `reminded` is declared-but-never-written per that
 * module's docstring — but the two-step guard is written generically over
 * "not already awaiting_payment" so it stays correct if that changes.)
 *
 * A lost race on either transition step is treated as an idempotent skip,
 * NOT an infra failure, mirroring `renewalComplete`'s own
 * `CycleTransitionConflictError` / `CycleNotFoundError` handling — the
 * paying invoice's OWN payment already succeeded independent of the
 * cycle-side bookkeeping race.
