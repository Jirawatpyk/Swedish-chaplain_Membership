/**
 * F8 Phase 5 Wave B · T123 — `markCycleCompleteFromInvoicePaid`.
 *
 * F4 `onPaidCallback` target. Fires once F4 transitions an invoice
 * from `issued → paid`. Resolves the linked F8 renewal cycle and
 * transitions it per FR-023 + FR-005b:
 *
 *   - Default: cycle.awaiting_payment → completed
 *     (emits `renewal_completed`)
 *   - Member has `blocked_from_auto_reactivation = TRUE`:
 *     cycle.awaiting_payment → pending_admin_reactivation
 *     (emits `renewal_completed_post_lapse`; cycle holds for admin
 *     review per T136/T137/T138)
 *
 * Atomicity caveat (research.md R12 / Constitution Principle VIII):
 *   F4's `F4InvoicePaidEvent` carries no `tx` handle, so this
 *   callback opens its own `runInTenant` tx that COMMITS SEPARATELY
 *   from F4's invoice-flip tx. There is a brief eventual-consistency
 *   window between "F4 marks invoice paid" and "F8 cycle updated"
 *   visible to concurrent readers. The window is bounded by:
 *     - This use-case's runtime (~5-50ms typical)
 *     - F4's `recordPayment` not throwing back through
 *       `onPaidCallback` rejections (it does — see F4InvoicePaidEvent
 *       docstring lines 14-18; an F8 throw rolls F4's tx back)
 *
 *   So the actual semantics are: F4 commit observes F8 commit ON
 *   SUCCESS (because F8 throw → F4 rollback), and an F8 success
 *   guarantees both rows commit. The "eventual consistency" risk is
 *   only on the FAILURE path (F8 throws → F4 rolls back → F8 already
 *   committed), which we MUST avoid by NEVER throwing from the
 *   callback after F8 has committed. The use-case implements this
 *   discipline: all F8 work runs inside ONE `runInTenant`; if it
 *   commits, no further code can throw.
 *
 *   A future F4 API change to thread `tx` into the callback would
 *   collapse this into a single tx — tracked as an enhancement.
 *
 * Cycle resolution: `cyclesRepo.findByInvoiceIdInTx` returns null when
 * the invoice is not F8-managed (e.g., ad-hoc admin invoice unrelated
 * to a renewal). Use-case logs + returns `'no_cycle_for_invoice'`
 * (NOT an error — F4 has many invoice types).
 *
 * Idempotency: re-firing the callback with the same event must be a
 * no-op. The cycle status check (`awaiting_payment` only) provides
 * this — a second callback finds the cycle in `completed` and short-
 * circuits.
 *
 * Out of scope (deferred to follow-on):
 *   - Cancelling remaining `renewal_reminder_events` rows (FR-023)
 *   - Dispatching the welcome email (FR-023)
 *   - Advancing `members.expires_at` (R3) + creating next cycle
 *
 * These need additional repo methods + gateway access; tracked via
 * tasks.md T123 follow-up sub-bullets.
