/**
 * T028 — `MarketingUnsubscribesRepo` Application port (F7).
 *
 * Tenant-scoped suppression list repository. Natural composite PK
 * `(tenant_id, email_lower)`; idempotent upsert is the primary write
 * pattern (replaying an unsubscribe is safe — last-write-wins with
 * appropriate audit chain).
 *
 * Retention: indefinite per GDPR Art. 21 + PDPA §32. Per the COMP-1
 * member-erasure design, `marketing_unsubscribes` rows are NEVER erased:
 * the WHOLE row — including the plaintext `email_lower` — is RETAINED so
 * the suppression invariant ("we will never contact this email again")
 * keeps working after the member is erased. `email_lower` is an
 * intentional, documented residual (see
 * `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-16-member-erasure-design.md` Known
 * limitations / deferred). The `setMemberIdNull` method below is currently
 * UNWIRED — no production code calls it, and the erasure path does NOT
 * sever `member_id`. Whether to sever the `member_id` back-reference while
 * retaining `email_lower` is a deferred US3 decision.
 *
 * Pure interface — no framework imports (Constitution Principle III).
