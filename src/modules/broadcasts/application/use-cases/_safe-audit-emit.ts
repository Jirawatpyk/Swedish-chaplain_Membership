/**
 * `safeAuditEmit` — fail-soft wrapper around `AuditPort.emit`.
 *
 * Purpose: preserve the SECURITY EFFECT of a rejection (e.g.
 * `broadcast_image_unsafe`, `broadcast_image_too_large`,
 * `broadcast_body_image_source_unsafe`) when the audit-storage layer
 * itself hiccups. Caller continues to return their original `Result`
 * (e.g. `err({kind: 'broadcast_image_unsafe', ...})`) — the audit-row
 * loss is logged at error level for ops/SIEM forensics + the http
 * response stays correct (422 reject, not bare 500).
 *
 * Without this helper, an audit-storage transient failure during a
 * security-rejection path bubbles as an unhandled exception, the
 * outer route catch maps to 500 `internal_error`, and the upload/
 * submit gets a misleading error code AND the security event is
 * silently dropped from the audit log.
 *
 * PR-review fix 2026-05-20 closes SF-H2 + SF-H3 + SF-H4.
 *
 * Pure Application logic — no framework imports beyond logger.
