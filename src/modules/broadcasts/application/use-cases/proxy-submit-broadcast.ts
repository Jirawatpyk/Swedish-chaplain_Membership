/**
 * T102 — `proxy-submit-broadcast.ts` Application use-case (F7 US2 / Q12).
 *
 * Admin-on-behalf-of-member submission. Composes `submitBroadcast`
 * with `actorRole='admin_proxy'`:
 *   - `requestedByMemberId` = proxied member id (whose quota is reserved
 *     and whose primary-contact email is reply-to)
 *   - `submittedByUserId`   = acting admin user id (for audit)
 *   - `actorRole`            = 'admin_proxy'
 *
 * #18 (single member read): the calling route already loads the proxied
 * member once (for the DV-17 `companyName` → from-name). It passes the
 * outcome in via `memberLookup` so this use-case does NOT issue a second
 * `memberExistsInTenant` probe. The route maps its single
 * `drizzleMemberRepo.findById` to:
 *   - found       → { status: 'found', companyName }
 *   - repo.not_found → { status: 'not_found' }  → broadcast_member_not_found (404)
 *   - other error    → { status: 'lookup_failed', message } → submit.server_error (500)
 * preserving the not-found(404)/infra-throw(500) distinction without a
 * second round-trip.
 *
 * The proxied member's quota cap IS enforced inside `submitBroadcast`
 * (T-10); admin_proxy gets no free broadcast.
 *
 * The acting admin path runs `submitBroadcast`'s rate-limit precondition
 * (d) unchanged. Halt-state precondition (FR-002 k) STILL applies —
 * admin cannot bypass a member's halt flag (R3-NEW-1).
