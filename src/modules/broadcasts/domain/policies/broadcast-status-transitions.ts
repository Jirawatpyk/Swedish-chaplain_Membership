/**
 * T026 — Broadcast state-machine transition policy (F7).
 *
 * Enforces the FR-004 + FR-004a state machine at the Domain layer.
 * Defence-in-depth pairs with the DB-level state-machine trigger
 * (data-model.md § 4.2). Both layers MUST agree — if they drift, the
 * Drizzle constraint will fire AFTER the Application's `transition()`
 * has run, surfacing as a ServerError instead of a clean Result.
 *
 * State machine (8 states; 4 terminal):
 *
 *   draft ──submit──> submitted ──approve──> approved ──send-now/cron──> sending
 *                          │                     │                          │
 *                          │                     │                          ├──ack──> sent (TERMINAL)
 *                          │                     │                          └──fail──> failed_to_dispatch (TERMINAL)

 *                          │                     ├──cancel──> cancelled (TERMINAL)  in submitted/approved only
 *
 * Terminal states (sent, rejected, cancelled, failed_to_dispatch) have
 * empty outbound adjacency lists.
 *
 * Pure TypeScript — no framework/ORM imports (Constitution Principle III).
