/**
 * Public barrel for the `broadcasts` bounded context (F7 — Email Broadcast).
 *
 * The ONLY surface that code OUTSIDE `src/modules/broadcasts/**` may
 * import from. The ESLint barrel-guard rule (eslint.config.mjs) blocks
 * deep imports into ./domain/**, ./application/**, ./infrastructure/**
 * from outside the module.
 *
 * This barrel currently exposes the Domain types + constants emitted
 * by Phase 2 Foundational Batch A (T020 + T024–T028). Use cases, route
 * handlers, and Infrastructure adapters arrive in subsequent batches.
 *
 * Constitution Principle III (NON-NEGOTIABLE): only Domain types +
 * Application audit-event types are exported. Drizzle Row types,
 * repository adapters, and port interfaces are intentionally NOT
 * re-exported — they are consumed only by Infrastructure adapters
 * within this module.
