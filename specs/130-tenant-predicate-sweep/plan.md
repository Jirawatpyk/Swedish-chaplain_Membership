# 130 — Plan

## Approach
- **The predicate value.** Use the repo factory's `TenantContext` slug, the same value `runInTenant` sets for RLS, so the two walls cannot disagree. Do not use the unused `_tenantId` port argument.
- **The gate.** `recordingDb()` is a `drizzle-orm/pg-proxy` db that records each statement and answers with no rows. It has no transactions, so the test passes the db in as the `tx`.
  - `tenantScopedTables()` reads every `/src/modules/**/schema*.ts` table that has a `tenant_id` column.
  - `tenantPredicateViolations()` counts each FROM / JOIN / UPDATE reference against its `"ref"."tenant_id" = $n`, or a correlation to another ref's `tenant_id`.
- **The insights SQL-shape test stays as it is.** Its quoted-name parse is its positive control. The new checker generalises it to bare names and aliases.

## Evidence

| Slice | RED commit | Failing line |
|---|---|---|
| s1 | `63d1893fd` | `small-repos.test.ts`: `expected [ …(7) ] to deeply equal []` (reminder events), `[ …(3) ]` (dispatch), `[ …(2) ]` (schedule policy), and 1 each for the at-risk read and the bounce `contacts` read |

Mutation proof for s1: from the committed GREEN, deleting `eq(contacts.tenantId, tenant.slug)` in `drizzle-bounce-event-query.ts` turned the gate red (`contacts: 1 reference(s), 0 tenant predicate(s)`); restoring it turned the gate green again.
